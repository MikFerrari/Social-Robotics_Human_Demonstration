# Social Robotics - Human Demonstration

## Introduction to generative models of a demonstratorâ€™s actions  
**Objectives:**
- Develop basic interactive learning algorithms: human behavior / demonstrations
- Compare performances of different strategies

In the framework of Reinforcement Learning, here applied to *gridworld* environments, both optimal and sub-optimal agents can be simulated. Aim of this work is generating such noisily-rational behaviours according to Boltzmann's probability distribution, in order to produce demonstrations that resemble the human way of reasoning.

To run the code, one can choose between:
- a *jupiter notebook* to be run in the browser -> *src/main.ipynb*
- a stand-alone *python script* to be downloaded and run locally -> *src/main.py*

N.B.: *main.py* relies on the *Grid* class, contained in the file *src/grid.py*

Finally, a **report** summarising the main results is available in pdf format and some **videos showing the agent learning** can be found in the *videos* folder.

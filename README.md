# Social Robotics - Human Demonstration

## Introduction to generative models of a demonstrator’s actions  
**Objectives:**
— Develop basic interactive learning algorithms: human behavior / demonstrations
— Compare performances of different strategies

In the framework of Reinforcement Learning, here applied to *gridworld* environments, both optimal and sub-optimal agents can be simulated. Aim of this work is generating such noisily-rational behaviours according to Boltzmann's probability distribution, in order to produce demonstrations that resemble the human way of reasoning.
